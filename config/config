#export RUNKI_OPTS="-p"

#
# RUNKI_AUX_CMDS specifies any additional tools/commands to be executed via /bin/bash -c
#
#export RUNKI_AUX_CMDS="command1;command2;command3"

#
# PERF_PROFILE_OPTS specifies any additional options passed to perf
# when collecting profile data
#
#export PERF_PROFILE_OPTS="-g"

#
# SAR_OPTS specifies options passed to sar, a null string disables sar collection
# 
export SAR_OPTS="-dpqrwWB -u ALL -P ALL -n DEV -n EDEV -I SUM" 

#
# Everything below only applies to cluster installations. In a cluster environment
# collection is initiated through pdsh, either from the command line or through the
# Cluster Management Utility GUI. 
#

#
# CMU_DATADIR	The repository for consolidated data on the CMU head node.
# This MAY ONLY be changed during installation.
#
#export CMU_DATADIR="/var/linuxki"

#
# NODE STAGEDIR	The directory in which nodes will stage their trace data during collection
# prior to copying it to the CMU head node. This can be changed between an "Uninstall from
# nodes" and "Install on nodes".
#
#export NODE_STAGEDIR="/tmp"

#
# PDSH specifies the location of the PDSH binary; typically either /usr/bin/pdsh
# or /opt/cmu/bin/pdsh
#
#export PDSH=/opt/cmu/bin/pdsh
#export PDSH=/usr/bin/pdsh

#
# PDCP specifies the location of the PDCP binary; typically either /usr/bin/pdcp
# or /opt/cmu/bin/pdcp
#
#export PDCP=/opt/cmu/bin/pdcp
#export PDCP=/usr/bin/pdcp

#
# RPDCP specifies the location of the RPDCP binary; typically either /usr/bin/rpdcp
# or /opt/cmu/bin/rpdcp
#
#export RPDCP=/opt/cmu/bin/rpdcp
#export RPDCP=/usr/bin/rpdcp

#
# WCOLL should point to a file containing a list of nodes subject to pdsh
# commands. If using CMU then CMU will set this automatically, but if not
# either the user must specify a value for WCOLL (see pdsh(1)), or it
# will default to /etc/pdsh/machines
#
# export WCOLL=/my/node/list
#
#if [ -z "${WCOLL+xxx}" ]; then 
#	export WCOLL=/etc/pdsh/machines
#fi

#
# EXPORTS specifies the location of the NFS exports file.
#
#export EXPORTS=/etc/exports

#
# PDSH_RCMD_TYPE specifies remote command type for pdsh/pdcp
# Non-CMU installations may require setting this if the defaults
# are not correct.
#
#export PDSH_RCMD_TYPE=ssh
